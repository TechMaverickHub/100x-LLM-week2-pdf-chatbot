# pdf-chatbot-100x
A FastAPI-powered chatbot that answers client questions strictly from an uploaded PDF. Extracts text with PyPDF2 and uses the Groq LLaMA-3.1 model for grounded responses. If the answer is not in the document, it politely declines. Built as part of the #0to100xEngineer OPT journey.
